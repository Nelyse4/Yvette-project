        Since its founding in 2008, Congo Week has united individuals and communities across 70 countries
        to stand in solidarity with the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Each year, we remember,
        raise awareness, and act to promote peace, justice, and dignity for Congolese people.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Democratic Republic of Congo, rich in natural resources such as coltan, cobalt, and copper,
        remains central to the global economy but faces immense challenges due to conflict, exploitation,
        and systemic injustice. Congo Week brings together voices from around the world to call for lasting
        peace and responsible global action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Led by student groups, community organizations, and Congo Week Ottawa-Gatineau, this initiative aims
        to empower the Congolese diaspora and allies to foster healing, reflection, and solidarity.
